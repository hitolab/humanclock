The detailed model for mammalian circadian clock consists of 180 variables and 70 parameters.

We numerically solved Kim-Forger model using  MATLAB code provided by the authors{kim2012mechanism}. To classify a type of bifuracation, we chose a variable as a representative of circadian dynamics, the concentration of Bmals in the nucleus. We hypothesized some of 70 parameters of this model depend on temperature $T$ , i.e., $k^\prime_i=\alpha k_i$ where ki represents the value of temperature-dependentparameter and $\alpha \in [0,1]$ is a tepmerature-dependent factor with 1 corresponding to high temperature and 0 to low temperature. 

code 1: Parameter value Factor \alpha dependent dynamics change of the bifurcation types analysis (Figure 4A).

1. Parameter name: Transcription Rate constant for \textit{Bmal} (trB)
   Parameter Number: parameterValueNew(5)
   Observations: As the tepmerature-dependent factor value decreased, the amplitude of oscillations gradually reduced to zero, while the period remained relatively constant.
   Conclusion: These results indicate the occurrence of Hopf bifurcation for the transcription rate of Bmal1.

2. Parameter name: Transcription Rate of \textit{Per1} (trPo).
   Parameter number: parameterValueNew(1).
   Observation: Both the amplitude and period remained stable as the factor value decreased from 1 to 0.
   Conclusion: These results suggest that no bifurcation occurs for the transcription rate of \textit{Per1}.

3. Three parameters were analyzed simultaneously to determine their combined impact:
   Parameter No. 63: Degradation rate of Bmal1.
   Parameter No. 30: Unbinding rate of Rev-erbs from NPAS2.
   Parameter No. 19: Unbinding rate of PER1/2 from CRY1/2. 
   Observations: As the factor value decreased, the period of oscillations gradually approached infinity, while the amplitude remained relatively constant.
   Conclusion: These results indicate the occurrence of SNIC bifurcation for this specific parameter set.

   To investigate bifurcation dynamics change with factor value decrease, we analyzed bifurcation types associated with various random parameter. The factor value was gradually reduced from 1 to 0, reflecting decreased temperatures. To identify potential Hopf or SNIC bifurcations dynamics change, we detected the impact of temperature-driven parameter changes on circadian oscillation.

code 3: Hopf bifurcations with 70 parameters (Figure 4B).
    
    The Hopf bifurcation was identified by gradually increasing the parameter up to 70. As the factor \alpha is reduced, the amplitude diminishes gradually while the period remains relatively constant, indicting a Hopf bifurcation.

code 4: SNIC bifurcations with 70 parameters (Figure 4B).

     If the period extends to infinity as the factor Î± is reduced while the amplitude remains relatively constant, the system is classified as exhibiting a SNIC bifurcation.
     
The Goodwin model{Gonze2020Goodwin}, incorporating a negative feedback loop, is used to classify the type of bifurcation that occurs as parameter values Factor \alpha change.
